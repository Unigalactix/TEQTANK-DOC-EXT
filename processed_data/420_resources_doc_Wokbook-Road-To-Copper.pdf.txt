DAY 1
Make your list of 100 using the leads sheet.
You may think you don't know 100 people but we promise you do Imagine you were getting married tomorrow.
You would be hard-pressed to keep it under 100.
Don't think too hard just start with your friends and family and move on to acquaintances.
It's time to make your list! The very sentence that makes MOST in the industry go BLAH and make the dreaded face of FEAR.
Then the doubt sets in:
· Do I have to call that person?
. I don't know that many people!
· This person wouldn't want to do it!
· Why did I do this to myself?
· Do I really have to make a list?
. I don't need a list.
. I use attraction marketing why do I need a list?
. All of my contacts are on Facebook why do I need to write down a list?
Do any of those sound familiar?

What ends up happening, to MOST new Network Marketers in the industry, is we get so caught up in the FEAR of WHO we have to talk to we don't understand the MOST important part of starting your business.
YOUR LIST.
Ask yourself this question."If I were to open my first shoe store wouldn't I make a list of invitations of who I would invite to come check it out?"
The answer is YES!
So your business in Network Marketing is no different.
I want you to go through the motions I am about to go over with you and not QUESTION my madness. Just go through the ACTION and IGNORE the FEAR for 20 min. Can you do that with me?
Say this with me,
"My list = my bank account".
Period.
Every 6 & 7 Figure earner in the industry:
1. Made a list
2. Has a running list
3. Adds to their list everyday
Say it again,"My list = My bank account".

Let's talk about when you start to build a team.
Not everyone will have an influence on social media, not everyone will have a warm market that is going to jump on board right away, and not everyone is YOU.
What we do our team does. Our team will NEVER do what we say. It's been proven. Promise.
We need to teach what DUPLICATES are and not just what works for us. This will create a lasting residual income for you and your family.
Let's have some fun what do you say?
