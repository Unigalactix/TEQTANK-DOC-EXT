An Affiliate can earn up to 30% discount on their own personal product purchases. The percentage discount available to an affiliate is based on their current Affiliate Level at the time of purchase.
Example 1
John joins the company as an Affiliate and purchases his first product. He gets a 5% discount because he is at the base "Affliate" level when he purchased the product. The product costs $100 so John only paid $95.
Example 2
Mary has been an Affiliate with company for a few months and her Affiliate level is Silver Affiliate. She purchases her normal monthly product order which costs $200 but Mary gets a 20% discount based on her Affiliate Level and only paid $160.

2 First Order Commission
When a customer or Affiliate places their first product order, the Affiliate who referred that person will get paid on the exact dollar value of the product order, excluding taxes and shipping. This commission is paid weekly on Friday based on the previous weekly pay period. All First Order dollars spent will count toward group sales for Affiliate Level Advancement.
The commission is 20% paid out to the referring Affiliate on level 1. There is also a commission of 5% paid out on level 2 to the referring Affiliates referrer.
Example
Rachel is an Affiliate who refers Allison who joins the company as an Affiliate. Allison in turn refers Monica who joins the company. Monica purchases her first order of $100 with the company. Allison gets the 20% bonus of $20 because Monica is her personally referred on level 1. Rachel gets the 5% bonus of $5 because Monica is on her level 2 of personal referral lineage
Rachel $5 First Order Bonus Paid
Allison $20 First Order Bonus Paid
Monica $100 First Order Purchased

The Frequense Compensation Plan is an exciting opportunity that rewards you for selling products and services and sponsoring other participants who do the same. Although the opportunity is unlimited, individual results will vary depending on commitment levels and sales skills of each participant. Since Frequense has recently launched, it lacks enough statistical data to prepare reliable income disclosures. There will be certain participants who will earn less while others will earn much more. We're excited about the Frequense Compensation Plan and we're confident it will provide you a solid foundation to help you achieve your financial goals. As with all endeavors, hard work and the time you dedicate impact outcomes. If income projections were presented to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not necessarily representative of the income, if any, that you can earn through your participation in the Compensation Plan. These income projections should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits. Success with Frequense results only from hard work, dedication, and leadership.
