STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 6 OF 44 :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected:
(vii) Provide positive guidance and training to Frequense Affiliates and Customers in their downline while exercising caution to avoid interference with other downlines. As such, an Affiliate is discouraged from providing cross-line training to other Affiliates Customers in a different Organization without first obtaining the consent of the Affiliate or Customer's upline leader;
(viii) Support, protect, and defend the integrity of the Frequense business opportunity.
1.2 Code of Ethics
a) Frequense desires to provide its Independent Affiliates with the best products and Compensation Plan in the industry. Accordingly, Frequense values constructive criticism and encourages the submission of written comments addressed to the Frequense Compliance Department.
b) Affiliate's negative and disparaging comments about Frequense, its products, these Policies, or Compensation Plan, made to Frequense, or to the field or at any Frequense meeting and/or event, or disruptive behavior at any meeting and/or event, serve no purpose other than to dampen the enthusiasm of other Affiliates and Customers. Frequense Affiliates must not belittle Frequense, fellow Frequense Affiliates, Frequense products or services, the Compensation Plan, or any and all Frequense directors, officers, employees, product suppliers, or agents. Such conduct represents a material breach of these Policies and Procedures and may result in suspension or termination of the offending Affiliate Account.
c) Frequense endorses the following code of ethics:
(i) A Frequense Affiliate must show fairness, tolerance, and respect to all people associated with Frequense, regardless of race, gender, social class, or religion, thereby fostering a "positive atmosphere" of teamwork, good morale, and community spirit.
(ii) An Affiliate shall strive to resolve business issues, including conflicts or disagreements with Upline and/or downline Organization Affiliate with tact, sensitivity, and goodwill, and take care not to create additional conflict.
(iii) Frequense Affiliates must be honest, responsible, professional, and conduct themselves with integrity.
(iv) Frequense shall not make disparaging statements about Frequense, other Affiliates, Frequense employees, product suppliers or agents, products, services, sales, and marketing campaigns, or the Compensation Plan.
(v) Frequense Affiliates shall not make statements that unreasonably offend, mislead or coerce others.
d) Frequense may take appropriate action against an Affiliate if it determines, in its sole discretion, that an Affiliate's conduct is detrimental, disruptive, or injurious to Frequense or other Affiliates.
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES

1.3 The Affiliate Agreement
a) Throughout these Policies & Procedures, when the term "Agreement" is used, it collectively refers to the most current version of the following along with any addendums or exhibits thereto: (i) Frequense Policies and Procedures; and (ii) Frequense Compensation Plan.
b) It is the responsibility of the Sponsoring Affiliate to provide the most current version of these Policies and Procedures (available on the Frequense website), the Income Disclosure Statement, the Compensation Plan, and any and all social media guidelines or any other guidelines which may be implemented from time to time and any amendments thereto to their downline Affiliate. The Income Disclosure Statement is attached as Addendum 1 and is incorporated by reference for all purposes.
1.4 Amendments to the Affiliate Agreement
a) Because federal, state, and local laws, as well as the business environment, periodically change, Frequense reserves the right to amend the Agreement as set forth on its website in its sole and absolute discretion. Notification of amendments shall appear in official Frequense materials, Frequense website, social media outlets, and/or the Affiliate's back office.
b) Any such amendment, change, or modification shall be effective thirty (30) days following notice by one of the following methods:
(i) Posting on the official Frequense website;
(ii) Electronic mail (e-mail); or
(iii) Any Frequense communication channels or social media outlets (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and/or Frequense App).
2.0 BASIC PRINCIPLES
2.1 Independent Contractor Status
a) A Frequense Affiliate is an independent contractor. An Affiliate is not a franchisee, joint venture Partner, business Partner, employee, or agent of Frequense, and an Affiliate is prohibited from stating or implying, whether orally or in writing, otherwise. An Affiliate has no authority to bind Frequense to any obligation. Frequense is not responsible for payment or co-payment of any employee benefits. An Affiliate is responsible for liability, health, disability, and workmen's compensation insurance. A Frequense Affiliate is responsible for their own managerial decisions and expenditures including all estimated income and self-employment taxes. A Frequense Affiliate sets their own hours and determines how to conduct their Affiliate business, subject to the Frequense Affiliate Agreement and any other guidelines that may be implemented from time to time.
2.2 Becoming a Frequense Affiliate
a) To become an Affiliate, an applicant must:
(i) Be of the age of majority (not a minor) in his or her state of residence;
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 8 OF 44
(ii) Reside or have a valid address in the United States, U.S. territory, or Canada in which Frequense is licensed to operate.
(iii) Have a valid taxpayer identification number (i.e., Social Security Number, Federal Tax ID Number (EIN);
(iv) Enter a verified mobile phone number that is not in use or associated with any other Frequense accounts, which will be verified through a verification code sent to the applicant's mobile phone number.
(v) Acknowledge and agree to all communications sent by Frequense, (including but not limited to emails, texts, broadcasts, letters, etc.) with the choice to "opt-out" of these communications.
2.3 New Affiliate Enrollment
a) A potential new Affiliate may self-enroll on any Affiliate/Sponsor's website, subject to acceptance by Frequense of the applicant's online enrollment confirming the applicant has agreed to all terms and conditions of the Affiliate Agreement.
b) Electronically submitted and/or signed documents, including, but not limited to, online submissions, automated credit card processing authorization documents, and the Affiliate Agreement are legally binding contracts that must not be altered, tampered with, or changed in any manner after they have been signed and/or submitted. False or misleading information, forged signatures, or alterations to any document, including business registration forms, may lead to sanctions, up to and including involuntary termination of the offending Affiliate's Account.
c) An applicant enrolling with Frequense must identify a Sponsor in the online enrollment process. If the applicant later enrolls and identifies a different Sponsor, Frequense will not accept the later enrollment. Frequense reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to make the final decision with respect to any disputes regarding Affiliate enrollments and Sponsors.
3.0 FREQUENSE AFFILIATE RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1 Correct Address
a) It is the responsibility of the Affiliate or Customer to make sure Frequense has the correct shipping address before any orders are shipped.
b) An Affiliate and/or Customer will need to allow up to seventy-two (72) hours for processing after the notice of address change has been received by Frequense Support Team.
3.2 Training and Leadership
a) Sponsoring Affiliates should have ongoing contact and communication with the Affiliates in their downline Organizations. Examples of communication may include but are not limited to, newsletters, written correspondence, personal telephone calls, team conference calls, voicemail, e-mail, personal meetings, training sessions, events, workshops, and any other related functions.
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 9 OF 44
b) A Sponsoring Frequense Affiliate should monitor the Affiliates in his or her downline Organizations to ensure that downline Affiliates do not make improper product or business claims or engage in any illegal or inappropriate conduct. Upon request, an Affiliate must provide documented evidence to Frequense of his or her ongoing fulfillment of the responsibilities set forth in this Section 3.2.
c) Up-line Affiliates are encouraged to educate and train new Affiliates about Frequense's products and services, effective sales techniques, the Compensation Plan, along with compliance with these Policies and Procedures, and any and all social media guidelines or any other guidelines issued by Frequense. Marketing product is a required activity in Frequense and must be emphasized in all Recruiting presentations.
d) Use of Sales Aids. To promote Frequense products and the Frequense business opportunity, Affiliates are encouraged to use the sales aids and support materials produced or expressly authorized by Frequense. Affiliates may use and publish marketing materials they design only after such materials have been approved by Frequense. An Affiliate's unauthorized use of sales aids or promotional materials, including but not limited to Internet advertising, and social media marketing on Facebook, Instagram, and like, is a violation of these Policies and Procedures. Additionally, publishing marketing materials that violate any number of statutes or regulatory laws governing how Frequense's products or business opportunity may be marketed is a violation of these Policies and Procedures and may result in immediate termination of the publisher's Frequense Account. Any such violations could jeopardize the Frequense opportunity for all Affiliates. Accordingly, Affiliates must submit via email all sales aids, promotional materials, advertisements, websites, training material, and flyers, along with any other literature to Frequense's Compliance Department for approval prior to use at compliance@frequense.com. Unless the Affiliate receives specific written approval to use the material(s), the request shall be deemed denied. All Affiliates shall safeguard and promote the good reputation of Frequense and its products. The marketing and promotion of Frequense, the Frequense opportunity, the Compensation Plan, and Frequense products and services shall be consistent with the public interest and must avoid all discourteous, deceptive, misleading, unethical, or immoral conduct or practices.
3.3 Sponsorship
a) The Sponsor is the person who introduces an Affiliate or Customer to Frequense, helps them complete their enrollment, and supports and trains those in their downline.
b) Frequense recognizes the Sponsor as the name shown on an applicant's first enrollment submission to Frequense.
c) An applicant may not enroll with Frequense as an Affiliate without personally accepting and agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Frequense Agreement.
d) Frequense recognizes that each new prospect has the right to ultimately choose his or her own Sponsor, but Frequense will not allow Affiliates to engage in unethical sponsoring activities.
e) All active Affiliates in good standing have the right to Sponsor and enroll others into Frequense. While engaged in sponsoring activities, it is not uncommon to encounter
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 10 OF 44
situations when more than one Affiliate will approach the same prospect. In this scenario, the new prospect should be Sponsored by the first Affiliate who presented a comprehensive introduction to Frequense products or business opportunity.
f) In the event of a dispute regarding Sponsorship, Frequense reserves the right to designate a prospect's Sponsor and all such determinations are final.
3.4 Unethical Sponsoring
a) Unethical sponsoring activities include but are not limited to, enticing, bidding, or engaging in unhealthy competition by attempting to acquire a prospect or new Affiliate away from a fellow Affiliate or influencing another Affiliate to transfer to a different sponsor.
b) Allegations of unethical sponsoring must be reported in writing to the Frequense Compliance Department within the first 30 days of the new Affiliate enrollment in question. If the reports are substantiated, Frequense may transfer the Affiliate or the Affiliate's downline to another Sponsor or Organization without approval from the current up-line Sponsor. Frequense remains the final authority in such cases.
c) Frequense prohibits the unauthorized manipulation of the Frequense Compensation Plan and/or marketing plant to trigger commissions or cause the promotion of a downline Affiliate in an unearned manner (hereinafter, "Stacking."). For example, Stacking occurs when a Sponsor places an Affiliate(s) under an inactive downline without the Affiliate's knowledge in order to trigger unearned qualification for commissioning purposes. Stacking is unethical and unacceptable behavior, and as such, it is a punishable offense that may result in the immediate termination of Accounts of all Affiliates, individuals, and/or entities found to be involved.
d) Any Affiliate who solicits or entices members of another direct sales company to sell or distribute Frequense products and services bears the risk of being sued by the other direct sales company. If any lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation is brought against an Affiliate alleging that they engaged in inappropriate Recruiting of another company's sales force or customers, Frequense will not pay any of the Affiliate's defense costs or legal fees, nor will Frequense indemnify the Affiliate for any judgment, award, or settlement.
3.5 Cross Sponsoring Prohibition
a) "Cross sponsoring" is defined as the enrollment into a different Line of Sponsorship of an individual, or Business Entity, that was already previously enrolled as an Affiliate. Actual or attempted Cross Sponsoring is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of the offending Affiliate's Account.
b) Enrollment through the use of a Spouse or relative's name, trade name, assumed name, Business Entity, or fictitious identification of any kind to evade or circumvent this Cross Sponsoring Policy is strictly prohibited.
c) This Policy does not prohibit the transfer of a Frequense Account and business in accordance with the Transfer of Sale or Transfer Policy set forth in these Policies.
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 11 OF 44
3.6 Solicitation for Other Companies or Products
a) A Frequense Affiliate and/or Customer may participate in other direct sales, multilevel, network marketing, or relationship marketing businesses or marketing opportunities, as long as it is not a Competing Product as defined herein. However, during the Term of this Agreement and for six (6) months thereafter, a Frequense Affiliate may not recruit any fellow Frequense Affiliate or Customer for any other direct sales or network marketing business, unless that fellow Affiliate or Customer was personally sponsored by such Affiliate.
b) The term "recruit" means actual or attempted solicitation, enrollment, encouragement, or effort to influence in any other way (either directly or through a third party), another Affiliate, or Customer to enroll or participate in any direct sales or network marketing opportunity. This conduct represents recruiting even if the Affiliate's actions are in response to an inquiry made by another Affiliate or Customer.
c) During the term of this Agreement, any Frequense Affiliate must not sell or entice others to sell, any competing products or services, including training materials, to Frequense Customers or Affiliates. Subject to the definition of Competing Products in the Glossary below, any product or service in the same category as a Frequense product or service is deemed to be competing regardless of differences in cost or quality.
d) An Affiliate may sell non-competing products or services to the Frequense Customers or Affiliates that they personally sponsored.
e) An Affiliate may not display or bundle Frequense products or services, in sales literature, on a website, or in sales meetings, with any other products or services to avoid confusing or misleading a prospective Customer or Affiliate into believing there is a relationship between the Frequense and non-Frequense products and services.
f) A Frequense Affiliate may not offer any non-Frequense opportunity, products, or services at any Frequense-related meeting, live or virtual, event, seminar, or convention that other Frequense Affiliates or Customers are known to be attending, or immediately following a Frequense event.
g) A violation of any of the provisions in this section shall constitute unreasonable and unwarranted contractual interference between Frequense and its Affiliates and would inflict irreparable harm on Frequense. In such event, Frequense may, at its sole discretion, impose any sanction it deems necessary and appropriate against such Affiliate or such Affiliate's positions including termination, or seek immediate injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond in addition to any other legal remedies to which Frequense may be entitled.

Upon termination of the Account, the downline Organization will roll up to the immediate, active Upline Sponsor.
b) If an Affiliate pays the membership renewal fee after it is due but within the sixty (60) day grace period set forth in Section 4.2(a) above, the Affiliate will resume the rank and positions held immediately prior to the membership renewal fee due date.

c) By enrolling as an Affiliate, you consent to Frequense charging your card an annual membership fee. This fee will be charged each year you elect to remain an Affiliate.

STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 13 OF 44

4.5 Unauthorized Transfer & Re-Enrollment
a) In the event an Affiliate discovers that an Affiliate in their downline has re-enrolled under a different Affiliate, the Affiliate has thirty (30) days from the date the downline Affiliate enrolled under a new Affiliate to notify the Frequense Compliance department and request the downline Affiliate be transferred back to his/her downline. Upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period, the right to re-claim a new Affiliate to his or her downline will be waived.
4.6 Change of Sponsors for Affiliate
a) Sponsor changes/corrections may be requested within a period of 72 hours from the time of enrollment. Such adjustments require written permission directed to the Support Department submitted from the personal back office of the Sponsor as well as the Affiliate to be moved and in some cases the Upline Affiliate.
b) Sponsor changes are generally not permitted. However, sponsor corrections can be made if they are reported to the Support Department within seventy-two (72) hours from the time of enrollment. Sponsor corrections must be requested from the Affiliate's back office of the current (original) Sponsor, stating the reason that the correction needs to be made.
c) At the discretion of Frequense, Affiliates who have not ordered products or services for at least six (6) months, and whose Account has not been terminated, are eligible to re-enroll in Frequense under the Sponsor of their choice.
d) When a former Affiliate re-enrolls with Frequense, Frequense will "compress" (close) the Affiliate's original Account, and a new Frequense User ID number will be issued to the Affiliate. In this scenario, an Affiliate does not retain former rank, downline Organization, or rights to commissions from the Affiliate's former Frequense business or Account.
e) Frequense reserves the right to correct Sponsor errors at any time and in whatever manner it deems necessary in its sole discretion.
4.7 Change Organizations

STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES

ship) with or in Frequense for six (6) months from the receipt of the notice before being eligible to re-enroll under a different Sponsor.
b) Frequense retains the right to approve or deny any request to re-enroll after an Affiliate's termination. Affiliates within the same downline Organization simultaneously submitting notices of voluntary termination to transfer Organization in accordance with Section 4.7(a) will be deemed an abuse of these Policies.
c) If re-enrollment is approved, the former Affiliate will be issued a new Frequense User ID after accepting and agreeing to the terms of the Affiliate Agreement in effect at that time. The re-enrolled Affiliate will not be entitled to keep any former rank, downline, or rights to commissions associated with the Affiliate's prior Frequense User ID/Account.

(ii) Date of termination;
(iii) Affiliate's Frequense User ID;
(iv) Reason(s) for terminating the Account, and

b) An Affiliate may not use voluntary termination as a way to immediately change Sponsors.

A terminated Affiliate who promotes Frequense products or services during the six (6) month waiting period by using another Affiliate's or Customer's referral code is in violation of the provision and shall not be permitted to re-enroll until six (6) months following any such offending conduct has ceased.
4.10 Involuntary Termination

d) The Affiliate who is involuntarily terminated by Frequense may not re-enroll as an Affiliate, either under his or her present name or any other name or Business Entity, without the express written consent of an officer of Frequense, following a review by the Frequense Compliance Committee.

Individuals of the same Family Unit, excluding spouses, may each enter into or have an interest in their own separate Frequense Account, only if each subsequent family position is placed frontline to the first family member enrolled.

b) Upon enrollment, Frequense will provide a Frequense User ID to the Affiliate. This number will be used to place orders, structure Organizations, and track commissions and bonuses.
6.8 Sell, Assign, or Delegate Ownership
a) In order to preserve the integrity of the hierarchical structure, it is necessary for Frequense to place restrictions on the transfer, assignment, or sale of an Affiliate's Frequense Account and business associated therewith.

Any attempted sale, assignment, or delegation without such approval may be voided at the discretion of Frequense.
c) Any approved buyer/assignee/transferee shall assume the position of the Affiliate at the current qualified title but at the current "paid as" rank, at the time of the sale and acquire the Affiliate's downline Organization.

a) Pending a divorce or dissolution of a Business Entity, the parties must adopt one of the following methods of operation:
(i) One of the parties may, with the written consent of the other(s), operate the Frequense business whereby the relinquishing Spouse, shareholder, partner, member, or trustee ("Relinquishing Party") authorize Frequense to deal directly and solely with the non-Relinquishing Party.
(ii) The parties may continue to operate the Frequense business jointly on a "business as usual" basis.

c) If a Relinquishing Party has completely relinquished, in writing, all rights to the original Frequense business and Account, the Relinquishing Party may immediately thereafter re- enroll under the Sponsor of his or her choice. In such cases, however, the Relinquishing Party shall have no rights to, and shall not solicit, any Affiliate or active Customer in the former Organization and must develop a new business in the same manner as any other new Frequense Affiliate. An Affiliate in the Relinquishing Party's former Downline who wishes to transfer to the Relinquishing Party's new Organization or to any other Organization must comply with the requirements in Section 4.0.

The Successor must:
(i) Accept and agree to all the terms of the Affiliate Agreement;
(ii) Comply with the terms and provisions of the Affiliate Agreement; and
(iii) Meet all of the qualifications for the last rank achieved by the former Affiliate.

record" to which all bonus and commission Pay-Out will be sent. Payments will be based on the current performance of the position, not the highest rank or volume achieved.
d) If the business is bequeathed to joint devisees, they must form a Business Entity and acquire a Federal Tax ID (EIN). Frequense will issue all bonus and commission payments to the managing Business Entity only.
e) Appropriate legal documentation must be submitted to the Frequense Compliance Department to ensure the transfer is done properly. To affect a testamentary transfer of a Frequense business, the Successor must provide the following to the Frequense Compliance Department:

7.0 DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
7.1 Imposition of Disciplinary Action - Purpose
a) It is the spirit of Frequense that integrity and fairness should pervade among its Affiliates, thereby providing everyone with an equal opportunity to build a successful business. Therefore, Frequense reserves the right to impose disciplinary sanctions at any time when it has determined that an Affiliate has violated the Affiliate Agreement, as may be amended from time to time by Frequense in accordance herewith.
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 21 OF 44
7.2 Consequences and Remedies of Breach
a) Disciplinary actions may include one or more of the following:
(i) Monitoring an Affiliate's conduct over a specified period of time to assure compliance;
(ii) Alerting the Affiliate's Upline so that the Upline may further educate the Affiliate and/or take proactive action to protect the Frequense community from cross- Recruiting, disparagement, etc .;
(iii) Issuance of a written warning or requiring the Affiliate to take immediate corrective action;
(iv) Imposition of a fine (which may be imposed immediately or withheld from future commission payments) or the withholding of commission payments ("Commission Hold") until the matter causing the Commission Hold is resolved or until Frequense receives adequate additional assurances from the Affiliate to ensure future compliance;
(v) Suspension from participation in Frequense or Affiliate events, rewards, or recognition;
(vi) Suspension of the Affiliate's Account and position for one or more pay periods;
(vii) Involuntary termination of the Affiliate's Account and position;
(viii) Any other measure that Frequense deems feasible and appropriate to justly resolve injuries caused by the Affiliate's violation(s); or
(ix) Legal proceedings for monetary or equitable relief.
7.3 Suspension Procedures
a) First Violation: Counseling and initial warning letter. A first violation usually occurs because the Affiliate is not familiar with the Policies and Procedures or the law. Counseling and the initial warning provide an opportunity for Compliance to bring to the attention of the Affiliate the Policies and Procedures and the specific violation, and to provide counseling on complying with the Policies and Procedures and applicable laws. The Compliance Department will also describe expectations and steps the Affiliate must take to resolve the violation including, but not limited to, either removing or revising the non-compliant claim or how to remedy other policy violations. Within three (3) days of this notice, Compliance will determine if the non-compliant material or other policy violation has been remediated. If so, Compliance will close the file. If not, Compliance will proceed to the 2nd Violation notice described below.
b) Second Violation: Second warning letter and temporary suspension. Although it is hoped that the Affiliate will promptly correct the violation(s), Frequense recognizes that this may not always occur. The second written warning indicates the seriousness of repeated violations and will prompt a suspension of the Affiliate's account. During the suspension period, the Affiliate waives any and all rights to Pay-Out of any bonuses or commissions
STATEMENT OF POLICIES & PROCEDURES
PAGE 22 OF 44 :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected:
and must submit a signed reinstatement letter wherein the Affiliate acknowledges the violation(s) and describes the steps taken to correct the violation(s). Once the reinstatement letter is accepted by Frequense, the suspension will be lifted, and the Affiliate will be able to request a Pay-Out. The Affiliate may be subject to additional discipline up to and including termination if the violation is not cured or further violation(s) occur.
c) Third Violation: Suspension and final written warning. Repeated violation(s) of the Policies and Procedures is very problematic and potentially harmful. Therefore, the most effective and prudent action is suspension of the Affiliate and forfeiture of commissions and bonuses associated with the offending Affiliate's Account. The final written warning letter will include notification of such suspension, action needed to cure the violations(s), and an indication that if the Affiliate violates the Policies and Procedures again, the Affiliate will be terminated immediately.
d) Fourth Violation: Termination. As described above, Frequense will try to exercise the progressive nature of the Discipline Policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning, and suspension and commission forfeiture before proceeding to termination of the Affiliate's Account. Frequense will notify the Affiliate in writing if/when the Account is terminated.
e) Frequense reserves the right to combine and omit steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the violation. Furthermore, the Affiliate may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action, as authorized by the Policies and Procedures.
8.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION
8.1 Grievances Against Another Affiliate
a) If a Frequense Affiliate has a grievance or complaint against another Affiliate regarding any practice or conduct relating to their respective Frequense businesses, he or she is encouraged to resolve the issue directly with the other party. If an agreement cannot be reached, it must be reported directly to the Frequense Compliance Department as outlined below in this Section.
b) The Frequense Compliance Department will be the final authority on settling such grievance or complaint and its written decision shall be final and binding on the Affiliates involved.
c) Frequense will confine its involvement to disputes regarding Frequense business matters only.

These issues go beyond the scope of Frequense and may not be used to justify a Sponsor change or a transfer to another Frequense Organization.
d) Frequense does not consider, enforce, or mediate third-party agreements between Affiliates, nor does it provide names, funding, or advice for obtaining outside legal counsel.

D. During the course of the investigation, the Compliance Department will only provide periodic updates simply stating that the investigation is ongoing. No other information will be released during this time. Affiliate calls, letters, and requests for "progress reports" during the course of the investigation will not be answered or returned.

8.2 Mediation Disputes Between an Affiliate and Frequense

8.4 Waiver
a) Only an officer of Frequense can, in writing, affect a waiver of these Policies and Procedures. Frequense's waiver of any particular breach by an Affiliate shall not affect Frequense's rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect the rights or obligations of any other Affiliate.

Deductions will occur in the month in which the refund is given and continue every pay period thereafter until the bonus/and or commission is recovered.
b) In the event that an Affiliate terminates his or her Frequense Account, and the amounts of the bonuses or commissions attributable to the returned products or services have not yet been fully recovered by Frequense, the remainder of the outstanding balance may be offset against any other amounts that may be owed by Frequense to the terminated Affiliate.

a) The Frequense program is built on sales to the ultimate consumer or end-user. Frequense encourages its Affiliates to only purchase inventory, in reasonable quantities, that they and their family will personally consume, will be used as a sales tool, or will be resold to others for their ultimate consumption.

Frequense retains the right to limit the amount of purchases you may make if, in our sole judgment, we believe those purchases are being made solely for qualification purposes instead of for consumption or resale.

INCOME DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
The Frequense Compensation Plan is an exciting opportunity that rewards you for selling products and services and sponsoring other participants who do the same. Although the opportunity is unlimited, individual results will vary depending on commitment levels and sales skills of each participant. Since Frequense has recently launched, it lacks enough statistical data to prepare reliable income disclosures. There will be certain participants who will earn less while others will earn much more. We're excited about the Frequense Compensation Plan and we're confident it will provide you with a solid foundation to help you achieve your financial goals. As with all endeavors, hard work and the time you dedicate impact outcomes.
If income projections were presented to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not necessarily representative of the income, if any, that you can earn through your participation in the Compensation Plan. These income projections should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits. Success with Frequense results only from hard work, dedication, and leadership.
